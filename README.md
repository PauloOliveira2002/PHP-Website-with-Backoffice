# PHP-Website-with-Backoffice
A PHP Website with backoffice and authentication.

The authentication is ocult, so you need to change the url to "p=admin" , example: http://localhost:8085/PHP%20Website/public/PHP%20Website/index.php?p=admin .
In the backoffice you can add photos and description to the carrousels in the HTML/CSS and Wordpress pages.
You can also check all the "emails" sent in the website cause all them will be saved in the database.

Feel free to use and reuse the code!
